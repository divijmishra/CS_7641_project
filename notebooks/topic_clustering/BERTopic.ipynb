The popular holiday strip has been stripped itself in major storms, earning it a spot among the state's 13 coastal erosion hot spots. None of the Hunter's beaches appear on that NSW Office of Environment and Heritage list, with four on the Central Coast the next closest to our region. Yet Wednesday's unveiling of the $4.1 million sand transfer system at Midcoast Council will be welcome news for parts of the region, particularly Swansea, where similar issues with sand persist. Midcoast Council bills its plan as a first for the NSW coast, an innovative plan that bears similarities to systems at Noosa and Lakes Entrance. During two 10-day campaigns a year, the system will shift sands from stockpiles at Winda Woppa to replenish the shoreline through 10 discharge points. Much of the sand is expected to be drawn from dredging of the navigational channel, with 10,000 cubic metres to be used in each campaign. Residents and authorities will be hopeful it is a system sophisticated enough to match the complex hydrology of Port Stephens. The system follows sand buffer plans that had been running as recently as March, when 5000 cubic metres was added to the beach between Guya Street and Kururma Crescent. The same amount had been dumped there in June the year before. Closing the loop at Jimmys beach, if it is achieved with the new sand transfer system as promised, will be met with cautious optimism along the Hunter's shores further south. The system is considered more suited to Swansea than Stockton, where sand depletion remains a major concern, but residents in that peninsula suburb will be hoping that lessons from a successful system can always be learned, considered and adapted. There are high hopes that this project will solve a problem that has outlasted countless MPs, engineers, locals and less effective plans. While there are concerns over the sourcing of the sand, those can be addressed once the effectiveness of the sand transfer system is tested and established. With winter conditions on the way, many eyes beyond the locals will be on how Jimmys beach withstands the sea's annual onslaught.\\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/iKQx4aiD4Q7fvCgDvFeGgz/07d93c46-a561-44f7-882d-25bf8be17978.jpg/r11_205_5065_3060_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg\\n\",\n          \"Cook County State\\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx is not going to resign. She\\u2019s going to run.\\nLast month, Foxx plunged into a white-hot controversy when her office dropped all charges against the actor Jussie Smollett, accused of staging a fake assault and claiming he was the victim of a hate crime.\\nOPINION\\nSmollett agreed to forfeit his $10,000 bond and perform a community service assignment, but he was not required to admit guilt.\\nThe decision triggered shock and outrage. The Fraternal Order of Police and the North Suburban Association of Chiefs of Police held a press conference on April 4 to bestow a vote of \\u201cno-confidence\\u201d on Foxx and demand her resignation.\\n\\u201cI was elected by the people of Cook County to pursue community safety, prevent harm and uphold the values of fairness and equal justice,\\u201d Foxx responded in a written statement. \\u201cI\\u2019m proud of my record in doing that, and I plan to do so through the end of my term and, if the people so will it, into the future.\\u201d\\nIn other words, she is running for reelection in 2020.\\nThere are questions. On Friday, Foxx announced she has asked the Cook County inspector general to review her office\\u2019s handling of the Smollett case.\\nThe venom leveled at Foxx is not about Jussie Smollett. It\\u2019s about taking down the first African American woman to serve as the county\\u2019s top prosecutor, and about her efforts to bring justice and equity to communities of color.\\nHer law enforcement critics, mostly white men, say Foxx is soft on criminals and an enemy of the police.\\nFOP President Kevin Graham appeared on the conservative Fox News network to declare that Smollett is just the \\u201ctip of the iceberg.\\u201d\\n\\u201cWe have had problems getting felony charges approved for battery to police officers,\\u201d Graham said.\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re saying: \\u2018this is enough.\\u2019 \\u201d\\nThe grandstanders yearn to return to the old ways.\\nIn 2016, voters chose Foxx over two-term incumbent Anita Alvarez.\\nThe tip of Alvarez\\u2019s iceberg: The police murder of 17-year old Laquan McDonald. Alvarez was seen as an apologist for the police, instead of an advocate for the community.\\nFoxx\\u2019s critics scream about Smollett, but they were silent when Laquan was shot down in the street like a dog. They said nothing while Alvarez waited more than a year before finally charging Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke with the crime.\\nFoxx promised to reform the criminal justice system. She has delivered equitable, humane policies.\\nFoxx is prioritizing resources away from low-level offenses to instead focus on violent crime. She has pushed to have those arrested on minor crimes to be released without a cash bail, so they can return to productive lives as they await trial. She has worked to overturn dozens of convictions of the wrongfully accused.\\nShe has hired more women and people of color, and she has advocated for sexual harassment awareness and training.\\nFoxx\\u2019s critics are quietly searching for an opponent.\\nPerhaps Alvarez, a vocal critic of Foxx in the media, is itching for a rematch?\\nJerry Joyce\\u2019s recent failed mayoral campaign had a law-and-order ring. That could set the stage for a Foxx challenge. Joyce would play well among police officers and others in his Southwest Side 19th ward, and beyond.\\nChicago Inspector General Joe Ferguson may take Foxx on.\\nAnd how about Bob Fioretti, the former 2nd Ward alderman and perennial candidate?

Let\\u2019s start with Steve Moore, a former Wall Street investment banker who is now an economic fellow at the Wall Street Journal. (In fairness, Moore also has his own White House-wide policy shop, where he serves as chief economic adviser to Paul Ryan.) At the moment, he appears to be mired in a heated nomination contest with Jay Clayton, the head of Lazard, the investment banking giant. Clayton was thought to have moved ahead in the race by proclaiming his support for the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law and business deregulation and months of cage-matching over 1,000-word op-eds for and against the federal budget.\\nBut here is the thing about the financial reforms of the past generation: They largely haven\\u2019t worked. In the early 1900s, states were permitted to set up their own stock exchanges because critics claimed this would increase investor access to the market. Yet the expansion of stock trading didn\\u2019t radically increase rates of participation\\u2014in particular, high-frequency trading, which was relegated to the more prestigious Nasdaq stock market and obscure regional exchanges. The idea of a single, federal-level regulator to oversee Mr. Market\\u2019s activities has since taken hold, and it never looked better than during the 2008, 2008, years. The army of federal regulators oversaw rapid growth in the financial industry over the preceding 20 years along with the first real signs of the subprime lending bubble. Wall Street nearly toppled the U.S. economy during the financial crisis\\u2014many financial institutions failed completely while others defaulted on debts and required bailouts\\u2014eventually reformed rules to regulate less risky, but still reckless lending practices, and what was left of the financial services industry started showing strains nearly three years ago.\\nRepublicans have not been shy\\u2014even leading lights in the various party leaderships\\u2014about fashioning voices of their own to replace the Democrats as the investors\\u2019 voice on the regulatory scene. Clyburn and Cotton met at the Waldorf-Astoria as recently as Saturday. Cotton in 2016 called the Dodd-Frank law \\u201can ideological giveaway to Wall Street.\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure anyone knows how Wall Street wanted it when it was crafted.\\nIn an earlier mission, Moore spent time at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, where he unsuccessfully warned that Democrats at the time were encouraging too much government spending. Moore\\u2019s views about the Fed are: \\u201cHigher inflation and higher interest rate are good things.\\u201d Then there is Moore\\u2019s involvement in Donald Trump\\u2019s campaign, which was set up as a way to revive the ailing \\u201cbond king\\u201d Moore. Now, it looks like the White House is going to ask the honor of reviving Steve Moore\\u2019s career. If candidates pick at Scott Walker\\u2019s forehead all January, the groundwork has already been laid.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 150,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"slate.com\",\n          \"nation.co.ke\",\n          \"dallasnews.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19884,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Convention organizer says more hotel rooms needed in downtown Indianapolis\",\n          \"China wants to destroy \\u2018wasteful\\u2019 Bitcoin mining\",\n          \"Why everyone is talking about a walrus scene on Netflix\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2019-04-01 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2019-04-26 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 26,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2019-04-14 00:00:00\",\n          \"2019-04-07 00:00:00\",\n          \"2019-04-15 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6027,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Nathan Layne\",\n          \"Greg Beacham, The Associated Press\",\n          \"Dan Fumano, More Dan Fumano\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ind30k\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10225,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 29999,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4847,\n          25153,\n          22261\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/The-Minutes-That-Saved-Notre-Dame-508689941.html\",\n          \"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/feel-sorry-for-jet-airways-vijay-mallya-tweets-renews-offer-to-pay-back-100/story-18rB9zi5XQcIKPJKDquyCP.html\",\n          \"https://globalnews.ca/news/5160465/star-wars-episode-9-trailer/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"machine\",\n          \"human\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"orig_split\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"gen\",\n          \"train_burner\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"split\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"train\",\n          \"val\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"random_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.0006064146162472,\n        \"min\": -4.26355665680627,\n        \"max\": 3.681804490581959,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 15000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.155566872403287,\n          0.6749276855105211\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"top_p\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
